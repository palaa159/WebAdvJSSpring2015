#### Course Description:
Over the the past 10 years, the internet is a huge birthplace for applications–from online
services to social media channels, useless to artsy. Among influences that catalyze and trigger
the possibility is JavaScript, a young powerful programming language for web and beyond. This
course serves as a gateway to modern JavaScript, delving into it simplicity and complexity. The
class will together investigate both client-side and server-side (Node.js) programming as a
crucial part of design process of making lively data-driven applications that live in different
platforms. By learning these, students will be able to employ the knowledge to create selfinitiated
projects, or at least having a better understanding of how data is handled. Students will
incorporate visual design, user experience design, interaction design and programming to bring
idea to life. The outcome of the course focuses on practical experience, students should be able
to design, build and deploy JavaScript applications. They should also be able to handpick
different components and work stacks or frameworks that will quicken a process of code
implementation. Web Advanced JavaScript aims to produce creative front-end developers,
technologists, artists and entrepreneurs with adequate understanding in web development.
#### Course Prerequisites/Dependencies:
PGTE 5505 is open to all graduate-level students in the School of Art, Media & Technology,
otherwise by permission. The course prefers students with web design and/or coding
background and is ideal for students who already enrolled lower-level web classes and/or
Bootcamp.
####Overview:
Welcome to Web Advanced: JavaScript. In this class I will show you the state of the arts of the internet. We will dive deep into the core communication of the web and the colossal internet using JavaScript as our vessel. Always keep in mind this is an advanced class, that being said
you must have at least intermediate web coding skills, and, but not limited to, bash scripting,
operating raspberry pi and physical computing, C++, python, mysql, or ruby. You'll be utilising
heavily of logical thinking, user testing, (almost) free cloud services, your talent and creativity –
bring out whatever you have to archieve high quality projects.
The class is geared towards creating practical web application with emphasis on bridging
server-side and client-side applications, but as well is open to all sorts of poetic and art
oriented.Class graduates are expected to be able to think, ideate, design, select the optimum
stack and architecture, and execute projects professionally.
The class starts with iterating basic JS statements, demystifying data-types, class, built-in
functions and nuances among other interpretive programming languages. We will learn how to
write proper JS that allows the code to be maintainable, readable and efficient.
By the nature of design/tech class, syllabus modification is normal later in the semester. Please
note that this syllabus is being treated as guideline. Nothing is set in stone.

##### Graduate
A	Work of exceptional quality
A-	Work of high quality
B+ 	Very good work
B 	Good work; satisfies course requirements
	Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of B or 		higher.
B-	Below-average work
C+	Less than adequate work
C	Well below average work
C-	Poor work; lowest possible passing grade
F	Failure
GM 	Grade missing for an individual

Grades of D are not used in graduate level courses.

####Grade of W
The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete.

####Grade of WF
The grade of WF is issued by an instructor to a student (all undergraduates and all graduate students) who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade. The WF is equivalent to an F in calculating the grade point average (zero grade points), and no credit is awarded.

####Grades of Incomplete
The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: [You should include one the following standards, depending on the level of your course].

Undergraduate students: Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “WF” by the Office of the Registrar.

Graduate students: Work must be completed no later than one year following the end of the class. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “WF” (for Parsons and Mannes graduate students) or “N” (for all other graduate students) by the Office of the Registrar. The grade of “N” does not affect the GPA but does indicate a permanent incomplete.

####Divisional, Program and Class Policies 

  * **Responsibility**
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for  in class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.

  * **Participation**
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.

  * **Attendance**
Faculty members may fail any student who is absent for a significant portion of class time. A significant portion of class time is defined as three absences for classes that meet once per week and four absences for classes that meet two or more times per week. During intensive summer sessions a significant portion of class time is defined as two absences. Lateness or early departure from class may also translate into one full absence.

  * **Blackboard or Canvas**
Use of Blackboard may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.

  * **Delays**
In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class. If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival. In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.

  * **Electronic Devices**
Use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

  * **Academic Honesty and Integrity**
The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

  * **Student Disability Services (SDS)**
In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/.
